# Learning To Code With C#
The main code repo for CoderPritt YouTube, Website, and Podcast

This repo houses all the examples and exercise projects for the CoderPritt website's tutorials and blog posts. The associated Podcast, and the YouTube videos. The purpose of this code base is to help other/perspective developers with simple and helpful examples that benefit everyone. We believe that programming is fun and exciting, not just challenging, and aim to reflect that in ever line.

Happy Coding!
